Optimizely Revenue Tracking for WooCommerce
=======================================

This function will allow you to add revenue tracking from WooCommerce purchases to your Optimizely A/B testing experiments.  It requires your project code from Optimizely to be placed in the header of your site.  This code will output a bit of javascript on the WooCommerce "Thnak You" page that allows Optimizely to know how much revenue was taken in there.  If your experiment is set to track revenue, then you'll be able to see your experiments effect on revenue.
